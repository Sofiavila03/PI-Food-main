            Hello! I'm Sofia, a professional with a passion for data and programming. After studying
            accounting, I delved into the fascinating world of data science and discovered a deep
            interest in programming. This led me to enroll in a full-stack developer bootcamp, where I
            have found immense joy and fulfillment in learning to create robust and dynamic
            applications from scratch. While my background in accounting provided a strong
            foundation, my transition to data science and full-stack development has ignited a renewed
            enthusiasm and sense of purpose. I'm excited about the endless possibilities this field has to
            offer and look forward to making a meaningful impact through my work in technology.
